## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)- strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://nextjs.org/) - Standard library routing in React

### Continued development

I want to take this project beyond the requirements to use all the features available by the api.

### Useful resources

- [Custom dropdown menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQFW3AtrDw4) - This Course taught me how to design custom dropdown menu using tailwind. I really liked fixed positioning of the button to emulate closing of the dropdown.
